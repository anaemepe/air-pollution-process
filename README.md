# Air pollution in Belgium: the process

Here you will find the data and analysis used for the air pollution project. You can find the live html here: <a href="https://anaemepe.github.io/air-pollution/">https://anaemepe.github.io/air-pollution/</a>

The original data can be found <a href="https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/the-cost-to-health-and-the/the-costs-to-health-and">here</a>. It was pre-cleaned by the 
<a href="https://correctiv.org/en/europe/">CORRECTIV.Europe</a> network, who also spotted errors and made the European agency fix them, resulting in stronger datasets. 

I wanted to find stories related to Belgium in this data. Out of different possible angles, I chose how much pollution costs. 

While there are over 200 industrial facilities recorded in the data, only a handful of them-30-that are responsible for over 80% of the pollution cost in one year. 

The northern part of Belgium, Flanders, is where most of these facilities are located. This makes sense with the country's economical tissue. However, while most traditional
energy companies claim now to be leaders of renewables, any efforts in these direction are not reflected in their polluting levels, which have remained with no significant changes
over a decade. 

## How I developed this project
This is a story that has been on my pitch list for a while. Since I only had two full days to work on the last Lede project, I turned to these datasets, whose existence I knew about as I'm part of the Correctiv network.

I first did some minor cleaning and explored the data to find an angle and a story.

The main takeaway is how much pollution costs and that only a few industrial facilities are responsible for it. I didn't find a chart to communicate this that I was happy with, so I created a simple handmade visualization.

I wanted to show how this plays out over time, and what has changed and what hasn't, so I displayed a dot plot of the companies behind the facilities and an area graph of the industrial sectors' evolution over time.

Finally, as readers, particularly those based in Belgium, may be interested in knowing if these pollution sites are located near where they live and their impact, I created a map.

## Skills I learned, etc.:
This has been a great exercise to play around with and learn how to portray change over time, using visualizations other than bar charts. I had very little time, so I was very conscious of which aspects were taking up most of my resources. For example, choosing the color and grading took me more time than I expected. Pollution is associated with grey, which is not a very appealing color for visual communication. I eventually went with a dark yellow, a color also associated with smog.

Another lesson learned was that maps are not always the best option despite the fact that what we are reporting on is strongly linked to a territory.

## This I would have liked to do:
Well, a zillion things. For example, I would have liked to use this project as an opportunity to further developed my D3 skills, but time was really, really limited.
