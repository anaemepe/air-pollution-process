# Air pollution in Belgium: the process

Here you will find the data and analysis used for the air pollution project. You can find the live html here: <a href="https://anaemepe.github.io/air-pollution/">https://anaemepe.github.io/air-pollution/</a>

The original data can be found <a href="https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/the-cost-to-health-and-the/the-costs-to-health-and">here</a>. It was pre-cleaned by the 
<a href="https://correctiv.org/en/europe/">CORRECTIV.Europe</a> network, who also spotted errors and made the agency fix them, resulting in stronger datasets. 

I wanted to find stories related to Belgium in this data. Out of different possible angles, I chose how much pollution costs. 

While there are over 200 industrial facilities recorded in the data, it's only and handful of them-30-that are responsible for over 80% of the pollution cost in one year. 

The northern part of Belgium, Flanders, is where most of these facilities are located. This makes sense with the country's economical tissue. However, while most traditional
energy companies claim now to be leaders of renewables, any efforts in these direction are not reflected in their polluting levels, which have remained with no significant changes
over a decade.
